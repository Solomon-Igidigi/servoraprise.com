  <h1>Shipping, Delivery & Returns Policy — ServoraPrise Ecosystem™</h1>
  <p><em>Effective Date: September 9, 2025</em></p>

  <h2>1. Scope & Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This policy governs all logistics, warehousing, and e-commerce delivery services provided under the 
    <strong>ServoraPrise Ecosystem™</strong>. It applies to all physical goods purchased, stored, 
    shipped, and delivered through our platform, as well as returns and refunds where applicable. 
    By placing an order, you agree to comply with these terms in addition to our general 
    <a href="/terms-of-service.html" rel="noopener">Terms of Service</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Shipping</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Orders are shipped via contracted carriers and courier services.</li>
    <li>Estimated delivery times provided at checkout are for guidance only and are not guaranteed.</li>
    <li>International shipments may be subject to customs duties, taxes, and import regulations, which remain the buyer’s responsibility.</li>
    <li>Optional shipping insurance may be requested at additional cost. Without insurance, liability for loss or damage is limited.</li>
    <li>Tracking details will be provided where available; accuracy depends on third-party courier systems.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Delivery & Customer Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide complete and accurate delivery addresses and contact details at the time of order.</li>
    <li>Ensure someone is available to receive the package at the stated delivery address.</li>
    <li>Signature or proof of delivery may be required. If you authorize delivery without signature, responsibility transfers upon courier confirmation.</li>
    <li>Inspect goods immediately upon delivery and report discrepancies, damage, or shortages within <strong>48 hours</strong>.</li>
    <li>Re-delivery fees may apply if delivery fails due to incorrect address or unavailability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Damaged, Missing, or Incorrect Goods</h2>
  <p>
    Claims must be reported within <strong>48 hours of delivery</strong> to 
    <a href="mailto:support@servoraprise.com" rel="noopener">support@servoraprise.com</a>. 
    Include your order number, photos of packaging and items received, and proof of delivery. 
    Resolutions (refund, repair, or replacement) will be processed in accordance with our 
    <a href="/refund-policy.html" rel="noopener">Refund Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Returns & Refunds</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Change of mind / non-faulty goods:</strong> Returns accepted within 7–14 days of delivery (depending on product type). Items must be unused, in original condition, and returned with all packaging/tags. Return shipping costs are the buyer’s responsibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Faulty, defective, or misdescribed goods:</strong> Eligible for repair, replacement, or full refund. Proof of defect may be required.</li>
    <li><strong>Perishable goods:</strong> Not eligible for return unless faulty or damaged on arrival.</li>
    <li><strong>Digital goods (e.g., vouchers, downloads, airtime/VTU):</strong> Non-refundable unless not delivered or defective.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Refund requests will be reviewed within <strong>5 business days</strong>. 
    Approved refunds are processed within 7–14 business days, depending on your payment provider.

    <li>Counterfeit, stolen, or pirated goods.</li>
    <li>Items restricted by aviation, customs, or courier regulations.</li>

    Non-compliance may result in confiscation, disposal without compensation, and reporting to relevant authorities.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Liability</h2>

    <li>Where shipment insurance is purchased, claims will be processed under the terms of the insurer.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Digital & Virtual Goods</h2>
  <p>
    In addition to physical products, ServoraPrise Ecosystem™ may offer certain 
    <strong>digital or virtual goods</strong> (such as credits, subscriptions, reward boosters, 
    or access passes) that are consumed or activated within our platform. 
    These items are delivered electronically and are <strong>non-refundable</strong> once purchased, 
    except in cases of technical failure or non-delivery.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Digital & Virtual Goods do not involve physical shipping or logistics.</li>
    <li>They may provide temporary or permanent access to features, services, or platform privileges.</li>
    <li>Transactions are final and cannot be exchanged, resold, or transferred unless explicitly permitted by ServoraPrise.</li>
    <li>Any misuse, fraud, or abuse of Digital & Virtual Goods may result in suspension or revocation without refund.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Governing Law & Disputes</h2>
  <p>
    This policy is governed by applicable Nigerian law and international shipping conventions where relevant. 
    Disputes will first be addressed through our internal dispute resolution process before escalation 
    to arbitration or courts of competent jurisdiction.
